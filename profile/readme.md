- Screwdriver (preferably electric).
- Drill bits.
- Many others...

### Software

- [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) - for design.
- [Real Cut 1D](https://optimalprograms.com/realcut1d.htm) - for minimizing the waste when cutting bars.

## Build instructions

- Cut the bars to required size and angle
- Build (weld) the structure

More details will be here ... [instructions.md](instructions.md)

## Cost

- Prices do not include manufacturing (which I did it by myself) and tools (which I already have).

- Prices are specific to my region (Cugir, Romania). I have not searched for better prices from distant stores. Prices do not include shipping (because I purchased the materials from nearby stores and the shipping was free).

- Prices include VAT.
